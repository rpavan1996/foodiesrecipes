          Ingredients
          Brown Onions (Note 1)
          2 Onions Large
          1/2 cup Vegetable Oil
          Chicken Marinade:
          700 grams Chicken Thighs and Drumsticks bone-in and skinless (Note 2)
          3/4 cup Yogurt or hung curd
          1/4 cup Tomato Puree
          1/4 cup Vegetable Oil
          1 tablespoon Ginger Garlic Paste minced ginger and garlic
          1 tablespoon Red Chilli Powder sub with 1 teaspoon Paprika + 1 teaspoon Cayenne
          1 teaspoon Turmeric Powder
          1 teaspoon Garam Masala Powder
          2 tablespoon Brown Onions
          1 1/4 teaspoon Salt
          Saffron:
          2 tablespoon Hot Milk
          10-15 Saffron strands
          Parboiled Rice (70% cooked):
          2 cups basmati rice Note 3
          6 cups Water
          2 tablespoon Salt
          1 Bayleaf
          5-6 Cloves
          2-3 Cardamom Pods
          Other Biryani Ingredients:
          1 cup Mint Leaves fresh
          1 cup Coriander Leaves Cilantro
          1 1/2 tablespoons Ghee or Butter
          To Serve:
          Crispy Brown Onions
          Onion Raita
          Instructions
          To make the brown onions, pat the onions dry and if time permits, leave them out on a kitchen towel for 15-20 minutes to dry them out slightly. Heat oil in a pan and add the onions. On a medium flame, shallow fry the onions for 15 minutes till they are a deep golden brown, without burning them. Drain them out on a paper towel, and set aside. These can be made ahead and stored in an air tight container overnight. Burnt onions will add a bitter flavor to the biryani. You can also use store bought fried onions/ shallots which are easily available in leading supermarkets, Indian and Asian stores.
          Mix together all the ingredients under chicken marinade and marinate for at least two hours or overnight for best results.
          When you are ready to make the biryani, soak saffron strands in hot milk and rub them slightly with the back of a spoon. Set this aside.
          Bring water to a roaring boil and add salt, whole spices and basmati rice. Cook for exactly 5 minutes and drain completely, leaving the whole spices in the rice. This will cook the rice to about 70% doneness which can be checked by pressing a grain of rice between two fingers – the rice should still be raw in the middle.
          Layering and Cooking Chicken Biryani: 
          Heat a heavy bottomed pot like  an oven and add the chicken to it. Cook for 4 minutes and then turn the chicken pieces once. Cover and cook for another 3 minutes. Turn off the heat. Scatter half the onions all over the chicken, and then all the coriander and mint leaves. Next layer the rice all over the mint and coriander, and in the end drizzle saffron milk and ghee all over the rice. Cover and cook on a low flame for 20 minutes – this will help steam the rice, cook it to doneness and cook the chicken. (Note 4)
          Once the biryani is cooked, let it rest for 5 minutes, and finish by scattering the remaining onions on top. Serve hot.

        <div id="demo3" class="collapse">
          Ingredients
1/2 cup unsalted butter softened to room temperature (113g)
½ cup canola oil (120ml)
1 1/2 cup sugar 300g
4 eggs room temperature preferred
1 Tablespoon vanilla extract
3 cups all-purpose flour (375g)
1 Tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/4 cup buttermilk room temperature preferred (300ml)
1 batch Chocolate or buttercream for frosting
Instructions
Preheat oven to 350F (177C) and prepare two deep 8″ round cake pans** by lining the bottoms with parchment paper and lightly greasing the sides. Set aside.
In the bowl of a stand mixer (or in a large bowl using an electric mixer) cream together the butter, canola oil, and sugar until creamy and well-combined.
Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.
Stir in vanilla extract.
In a separate, medium-sized bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt.
Using a spatula and gently hand-mixing, alternate adding flour mixture and buttermilk to the butter mixture, starting and ending with flour mixture and mixing until just combined after each addition.
The batter should be smooth and completely combined but avoid over-mixing.
Evenly divide batter into your prepared cake pans, and bake on 350F (175C) for 30-35 minutes. When the cake is done, the surface should spring back to the touch and a toothpick inserted in the center should come out mostly clean with few moist crumbs.
Allow cakes to cool in their cake pans for 10-15 minutes before inverting onto a cooling rack to cool completely before frosting.

          Strawberry Sauce:
          4 ounces (120 grams) fresh or frozen  unsweetened strawberries
          1 - 2 tablespoons (15-25 grams) granulated white sugar, or to taste
          Vanilla Genoise:
          6 large (300 grams) eggs
          1 cup (200 grams) granulated white sugar
          1 teaspoon (4 grams) pure vanilla extract
          1 2/3 cups (200 grams) cake flour
          2 tablespoons (25 grams) warm melted butter
          Soaking Syrup:
          1/2 cup (120 ml/grams) filtered water
          1/4 cup (50 grams) granulated white sugar
          2 tablespoons Limoncello or Grand Marnier (or lemon or orange juice)
          Strawberry Cream:
          1/2 cup (120 ml) cold strawberry sauce (recipe above)
          1 envelope (1/4 ounce) (7 grams) unflavored powdered gelatin
          2 cups (480 ml) cold heavy whipping cream (cream with a 35-40% butterfat content)
          1/4 cup (30 grams) confectioners (powdered or icing) sugar, or to taste
          2 cups (480 ml) (300 grams) fresh strawberries, cut into bite sized pieces
          Garnish:
          Fresh Strawberries
          To assemble the Strawberry Cake:  Place one cake layer (top of the cake facing down) on a 9 inch (23 cm) cake circle and then place on a cake turntable or your serving plate.  With a pastry brush, moisten the cake with some of the soaking syrup. Spread a thin layer of Strawberry Cream on the cake. Next, pipe a ring of the Strawberry Cream around the outside edge of the cake. Then pipe a second ring of Strawberry Cream on top of the first. Take the cut strawberries and fill inside the rings of Cream. Then spread a thin layer of the Strawberry Cream on top of the strawberries. Next, brush the top side of the second layer of genoise with the soaking syrup. Then place the cake layer, top side down, on top of the filling. Gently press the top of the cake to compact. Brush the top of the cake with soaking syrup. Cover the entire cake with Strawberry Cream. Using a flat edge spatula or metal scraper, smooth the frosting on the top and sides of the cake. Cover and refrigerate for several hours (or overnight) so the cream has time to set. Can be covered and stored in the refrigerator for two to three days.

          Vegetable Biryani Ingredients
Vegetables: Add vegetables of your choice, few other options are potatoes, mushrooms, bell pepper, zucchini. However some vegetables like cauliflower cook faster so cut them into large florets. Cut other vegetables like beans, carrots into 1 inch each. In addition i have added paneer for protein.
Rice: Traditionally long grain Basmati Rice is used for making biryani and I have used white basmati rice for this recipe.
Fried Onions: I have used store brought fried onions since it saves time. If you don't have them handy, then take 1 large onion, thinly slice them and saute with 2 tablespoons of oil till they caramelize or you can deep fry them too.
Water: I have used 1.25 cups of water for every cup of Basmati rice to make this biryani in Instant Pot. Adjust water based on type and quality of rice.
Biryani Masala Powder: You can get biryani masala powder from any Indian grocery store or amazon or can make at home itself. You can use any brands, I have used biriyani masala for today’s recipe. I highly recommend using Shan Biryani Masala because it gives Restaurant Style Veg Biryani taste. However, if you don't have biryani powder, replace with same quantity of garam masala powder.
Spices & Herbs: You can increase or decrease spices according to your preference.
